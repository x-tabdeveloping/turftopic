# Contributing to Turftopic

We do our best to maintain Turftopic, and any help or suggestions are most welcome from the community including:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

## Setting up your environment

#### Installing dependencies

Install all developer dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install turftopic[dev]
```

#### Formatting

We use black and isort on all files and encourage you to do the same. Code formatted with Ruff will also be accepted:

```bash
pip install black isort

python3 -m black turftopic/
python3 -m isort turftopic/
```

#### Running tests

To run tests locally run:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/
```

#### Running documentation

You can build the documentation and host it locally by running:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/x-tabdeveloping/turftopic/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/x-tabdeveloping/turftopic/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
